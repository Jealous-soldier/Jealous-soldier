# Hey, I'm Bhanu 👋

I'm a curious blend of designer, data enthusiast, and problem-solver — with a background in Zoology and a future in building impactful, user-focused solutions.

## 🌱 About Me

By training, I studied life sciences. But somewhere along the way, I got obsessed with how people *interact* with systems — and how we can make those systems more useful, intuitive, and insightful. Whether it's creating visual experiences or digging into analytics, I'm driven by the same thing: clarity and impact.

Today, I work at the intersection of design, data, and digital content — creating tools, strategies, and visuals that actually help people.

## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

- **Design Thinking** – Prototyping, user flow design, feedback loops, and UI systems.
- **Data & Analytics** – Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI — all the tools to make data tell its story.
- **Content Strategy** – Built and scaled academic content pipelines across 40+ courses.
- **Collaboration & Leadership** – Led teams, mentored editors, and aligned people toward shared goals.
- **Storytelling** – Whether it's a pitch deck or a campaign, I know how to turn insight into persuasion.

## 🌍 Beyond Work

I’ve organized fundraisers, taught workshops, led design teams, and volunteered in the Himalayas. I believe leadership means showing up, even when nobody's watching.
